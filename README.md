# GenAI-Image-Colorization
# Image Colorization Projects

This project includes implementations of 9 different image colorization tasks using Python and deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow/Keras, as well as simple GUI support where applicable.

## Project structure

- `basic_colorization.py` : Basic image colorization models (Tasks 1 & 2)
- `conditional_colorization.py` : User-conditioned colorization (Task 3)
- `semantic_segmentation_colorization.py` : Semantic segmentation colorization (Tasks 4 & 8)
- `artistic_style_transfer_colorization.py` : Style transfer combined with colorization (Task 5)
- `interactive_user_guided_colorization.py` : Interactive user-guided colorization (Tasks 6 & 7)
- `video_real_time_colorization.py` : Real-time multi-object colorization with semantic segmentation (Task 8)
- `historical_time_based_colorization.py` : Time period aware historical image colorization (Task 9)
- `utils.py` : Utility functions and helpers
- `requirements.txt` : Python dependencies

## Setup
